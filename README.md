# Spotify Songs Clustering

This is the final project for the course **ADY201m - Introduction to Data Science**.

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to group Spotify songs into clusters based on their audio features such as:

- Danceability  
- Energy  
- Acousticness  
- Instrumentalness  
- Tempo  
- Valence  
- And more...

Clustering helps identify patterns in music and group songs with similar characteristics, potentially useful for recommendation systems or genre classification.

## Dataset

- `SpotifyFeatures.csv`: Contains various songs along with metadata such as song name, artist, genre, and audio features.

## Main Content

- Data preprocessing  
- Feature scaling  
- Clustering using K-Means  
- Visualizing clusters  
- Interpreting the results

## Main Notebook

- `src.ipynb`: Contains the entire analysis and clustering process.
